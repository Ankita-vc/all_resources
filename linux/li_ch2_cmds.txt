The Bourne Shell: /bin/sh
--A shell is a program that runs commands, like the ones that users enter

--There are many different Unix shells, but all derive several of their
features from the Bourne shell (/bin/sh), a standard shell developed at Bell
Labs for early versions of Unix.

Basic commands in Linux:

1) Cat -
cmd:- $ cat file1 file2
When you run this command, cat prints the contents of file1 , file2 ,
and any other files that you specify (denoted by ... ), and then exits. The
command is called cat because it performs concatenation when it prints
the contents of more than one file.

2) Standard Input and Standard Output - 
Unix processes use I/O streams to read and write data.
Streams are very flexible.
For example, the source of an input stream can be a file, a device, a termi-
nal, or even the output stream from another process.

The cat command repeats any line that you type.
press ctrl -D on an empty line to terminate cat and return to the shell
prompt.
The reason cat adopted an interactive behavior has to do with streams.
Because you did not specify an input filename, cat read from the standard
input stream provided by the Linux kernel rather than a stream connected
to a file. In this case, the standard input was connected to the terminal in
which you ran cat .

Pressing ctrl -D
on an empty line stops the current standard input entry from the
terminal (and often terminates a program). Donâ€™t confuse this with ctrl -C, which
terminates a program regardless of its input or output.
